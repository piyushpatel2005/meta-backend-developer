# Coding Interivew Preparation

## Module 1:
This course introduces what coding interview is, what types of interview you might face, how to focus on thought process, how to work with pseudo code. This course also provides computer science introduction with RAM, ROM memory and how they are used. Next, it introduces Big-O notation and how it applies to algorithms.

The outcomes of this module are:
- Be prepared for the interview process
- Have a strategy and a collection of tips to prepare you for successful interviews
- Recognize the role pseudocode plays in coding interviews and 
- Grasp the fundamentals of computer science

- [Knowledge Check: Coding Interview](module1/coding_interview.html)
- [Knowledge Check: Time Complexity](module1/time_complexity.html)
- [Quiz](index.html)

## Module 2: Data Structures

Data structures and limitations of those. 
It covers
- Arrays
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Heaps
- Graphs

## Module 3. Algorithms

It covers selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. For searching algorithm, divide and conquer, recursion, greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.

## Module 4: Final Project

This will assess your knowledge of data structures, algorithms and coding interview preparation.
